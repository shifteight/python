The following corrections apply to the first edition of the book. If you have something else to report please contact the author at flaskbookfeedback@gmail.com.

Chapter 3, Example 3-3
The URL of the first route is incorrectly shown as /index, while the correct URL is /. (Reported by Farhad Fouladi)

Chapter 4, Section "HTML Rendering of Forms"
The punctuation in the first sentence is incorrect. The correct sentence should read "Form fields are callables that, when invoked from a template, render themselves to HTML.". (Reported by Ken Hommel)

Chapter 4, Section "HTML Rendering of Forms"
The first two code examples in this section show how to render a form in a template, but are incomplete as they do not show how to implement CSRF protection. The corrected examples are shown below:

<form method="POST">
{{ form.hidden_tag() }}
{{ form.name.label }} {{ form.name() }}
{{ form.submit() }}
</form>
<form method="POST">
{{ form.hidden_tag() }}
{{ form.name.label }} {{ form.name(id='my-text-field') }}
{{ form.submit() }}
</form>
The {{ form.hidden_tag() }} line adds a hidden field to the form where Flask-WTF stores the CSRF token. Note that CSRF support is included in Flask-Bootstrap's `wtf.quick_form()` macro, so this is only needed when rendering forms manually. (Reported by Richard Milne)

Chapter 4, Example 4-3
The text that follows the example incorrectly indicates that the format of a Jinja2 conditional is {% if variable %}...{% else %}...{% endif %}, but really should have used the term condition instead of variable. (Reported by Marco Agner)

Chapter 4, Example 4-6
In this example the line of code that reads form.name.data = '' should not be in this function, as it has no effect. (Reported by Steven Marcatante)

Chapter 5, Example 5-4
The pathname printed in the heading of this example is incorrect. The correct pathname is hello.py. (Reported by Napoleon)

Chapter 6, Table 6-1
The configuration variable that stores the email server hostname is incorrect. The correct variable is MAIL_SERVER. (Reported by Christian Hettlage)

Chapter 7, Example 7-5
A dot is missing in the import statement that imports the blueprint. The correct import statement is from .main import main as main_blueprint. (Reported by Erik de Wildt)

Chapter 8, Example 8-9
The example does not import the Length validator. The import line that imports the validators is: from wtforms.validators import Required, Length, Email. (Reported by Ken Hommel and Dan Carpenter)

Chapter 8, Example 8-20
The pathname printed in the heading of this example is incorrect. The correct pathname is app/templates/auth/email/confirm.txt. (Reported by John Baham, Jr.)

Chapter 8, Example 8-22
The before_request() handler was coded to deny any requests outside of the auth blueprint, but this effectively prevents static files from being served. Normally this isn't a problem because the static files were already cached in the client web browser, but a correct handler is shown below:
@auth.before_app_request
def before_request():
    if current_user.is_authenticated() \
            and not current_user.confirmed \
            and request.endpoint[:5] != 'auth.' \
            and request.endpoint != 'static':
        return redirect(url_for('auth.unconfirmed'))
This change allows static files such as image, Javascript and CSS files to be served to unconfirmed users. (Reported by Michael Graupner)

Chapter 8, Example 8-22
The redirect() call in route unconfirmed() is incorrectly printed. The correct line is return redirect(url_for('main.index')). (Reported by Arne Wiese)

Chapter 8, Example 8-23
The correct code example is shown below:
@auth.route('/confirm')
@login_required
def resend_confirmation():
token = current_user.generate_confirmation_token()
send_email(current_user.email, 'Confirm Your Account',
'auth/email/confirm', user=current_user, token=token)
flash('A new confirmation email has been sent to you by email.')
return redirect(url_for('main.index'))
The version printed in the book has an incorrect argument list in the call to the `send_email()` function. (Reported by Wang Yandong)

Chapter 9, Example 9-6
The code example is missing one import: from .models import Permission. (Reported by Jonathan Kapelus)

Chapter 10, Example 10-8
The code example contains a typo. The line that reads db.session.add(user) should be db.session.add(current_user). (Reported by Lukasz Gabrych)

Chapter 11, Example 11-15, and Chapter 12, Examples 12-3, 12-7, 12-10, 12-11
The pathname printed in the heading of these examples is incorrect. The correct pathname is app/models.py. (Reported by John Baham, Jr.)

Chapter 14, section "Creating an API Blueprint"
The filenames of some of the files in the api_1_0 folder are in singular, while they should be plural to match the source code on GitHub. These are users.py, posts.py and comments.py. (Reported by John Baham, Jr.)

Chapter 15, Example 15-5
The "write a post" portion of the test includes an incorrect body string that does not have correct Markdown styling. The correct sentence should be data = json.dumps ({ 'body' : 'body of the *blog* post' })). (Reported by Dmitry Zhuravlev-Nevsky)
